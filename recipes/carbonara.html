        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with <em>eggs, 
            hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper</em>. The dish arrived 
            at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of 
            the 20th century. The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, 
            Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination of the two.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) package pancetta bacon, diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2.5 cups whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>8 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring 
                occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 
                <strong>12 minutes</strong>. Drain.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large, heavy frying pan 
                over medium heat. Add pancetta and garlic; saute until 
                brown and crisp, about <strong>8 minutes</strong>. Remove from the heat 
                and cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Whisk cream, Parmesan, egg yolks, basil, and parsley 
                together in a large bowl until well blended.</li>
            <li>Stir chicken into the pancetta mixture until combined. 
                Add cooked spaghetti and cream mixture. Toss over 
                medium-low heat until chicken is heated through and 
                sauce forms a thick coating over the spaghetti, about <strong>4 
                minutes</strong>. Do not boil or the eggs will scramble. Season 
                with salt and pepper and transfer to a large, wide 
                serving bowl.</li>
        </ol>
