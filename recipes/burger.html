        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>It attacks your taste buds! <em>Spicy chorizo-style sausage and 
            lean ground turkey</em> combine to make a kick-butt burger 
            that's full of taste but won't leave you feeling stuffed.

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine ground turkey, chorizo, garlic, onion powder, 
                chipotle flakes, and black pepper in a large bowl; 
                mix with your hands until well-blended. Shape into 4 
                loosely-packed patties.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat until 
                hot; grease with buttery spread. Place patties on the 
                griddle; cook until browned, about <strong>3 minutes</strong>. Reduce 
                heat to medium-low; continue cooking for about <strong>5 minutes</strong>. 
                Flip patties and cook until browned on the second side, 
                about <strong>6 minutes</strong>.</li>
            <li>Top each patty with a slice of pepperjack cheese. 
                Cook until cheese is melted, about <strong>1 minute</strong> more.</li>
            <li>Toast hamburger buns in a toaster oven. Spread 1 1/2 
                teaspoon mayonnaise over each half. Place cooked patties 
                over bottom buns. Top each patty with 1/2 cup spring 
                mix lettuce. Sprinkle lime juice over lettuce. Cover 
                with top buns.</li>
